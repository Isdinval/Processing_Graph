# IÂ°) Breadth First Search - Pseudocode

Breadth first traversal is accomplished by enqueueing each level of a tree sequentially as the root of any subtree is encountered. There are 2 cases in the iterative algorithm.

- Root case: The traversal queue is initially empty so the root node must be added before the general case.
General case: Process any items in the queue, while also expanding their children. Stop if the queue is empty. The general case will halt after processing the bottom level as leaf nodes have no children.
Input: A search problem. A search-problem abstracts out the problem specific requirements from the actual search algorithm.

- Output: An ordered list of actions to be followed to reach from start state to the goal state.
